	<string>Thanks for using Planky! These terms of service (&quot;Terms&quot;) cover your use and access to our services, client software and websites (&quot;Services&quot;). 

Your Stuff &amp; Your Permissions

When you use our Services, you provide us with things like your files, content, email address, contacts and so on (&quot;Your Stuff&quot;). Your Stuff is yours. These Terms don&apos;t give us any rights to Your Stuff except for the limited rights that enable us to offer the Services.

We need your permission to do things like scanning Your Stuff, backing it up with a third party cloud service api, and sharing it when you ask us to. We use your favorite Cloud Service provider, like Dropbox, and do not host your photos on any of our servers. We only keep track of how many photos are located on your Cloud Service. These and other features may require our systems to access, store and scan Your Stuff. You give us permission to do those things, and this permission extends to our affiliates and trusted third parties we work with.

Sharing Your Stuff

Our Services let you share Your Stuff with others, so please think carefully about what you share.

Your Responsibilities

You&apos;re responsible for your conduct. Content in the Services may be protected by others&apos; intellectual property rights. Please don&apos;t copy, upload, download or share content unless you have the right to do so.

We aren&apos;t responsible for the content people post and share via the Services.

Software

Some of our Services allow you to download client software (&quot;Software&quot;) which may update automatically. So long as you comply with these Terms, we give you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to access the Services. To the extent any component of the Software may be offered under an open source license, we&apos;ll make that license available to you and the provisions of that license may expressly override some of these Terms. Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by law, you agree not to reverse engineer or decompile the Services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so.

Beta Services

We sometimes release products and features that we are still testing and evaluating. Those Services have been marked beta, preview, early access, or evaluation (or with words or phrases with similar meanings) and may not be as reliable as Planky’s other services, so please keep that in mind.

Our Stuff

The Services are protected by copyright and trademark. These Terms don&apos;t grant you any right, title or interest in the Services, others&apos; content in the Services, Planky trademarks, logos and other brand features. We welcome feedback, but note that we may use comments or suggestions without any obligation to you.

Privacy 

Your privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and disclose and make use of personal information. The following outlines our privacy policy.

Before or at the time of collecting personal information, we will identify the purposes for which information is being collected.
We will collect and use of personal information solely with the objective of fulfilling those purposes specified by us and for other compatible purposes, unless we obtain the consent of the individual concerned or as required by law.
We will only retain personal information as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes.
We will collect personal information by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the individual concerned.
Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used, and, to the extent necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete, and up-to-date.
We will protect personal information by reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.
We will make readily available to customers information about our policies and practices relating to the management of personal information.
In the event of an acquisition or merger with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.
In unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors&apos; rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.

We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with these principles in order to ensure that the confidentiality of personal information is protected and maintained.

Copyright

We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. 

Paid Accounts

Billing. You can increase the number of photos covered by compression and add paid features to your account (turning your account into a &quot;Paid Account&quot;). We&apos;ll automatically bill you from the date you convert to a Paid Account and on each periodic renewal until cancellation. You&apos;re responsible for all applicable taxes, and we&apos;ll charge tax when required to do so.

No Refunds. You may cancel your Planky Paid Account at any time but you won&apos;t be issued a refund.

Downgrades. Your Paid Account will remain in effect until it&apos;s cancelled or terminated under these Terms. If you don&apos;t pay for your Paid Account on time, we reserve the right to suspend it or reduce your storage to free space levels.

Changes. We may change the fees in effect but will give you advance notice of these changes via a message to the email address associated with your account.

Termination

You&apos;re free to stop using our Services at any time. We also reserve the right to suspend or end the Services at any time at our discretion and without notice. For example, we may suspend or terminate your use of the Services if you&apos;re not complying with these Terms, or use the Services in a manner that would cause us legal liability, disrupt the Services or disrupt others&apos; use of the Services. Except for Paid Accounts, we reserve the right to terminate and delete your account if you haven&apos;t accessed our Services for 12 consecutive months. We&apos;ll of course provide you with notice via the email address associated with your account before we do so.

Services &quot;AS IS&quot;

We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we can&apos;t guarantee. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, Planky AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED &quot;AS IS.&quot; WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

Some places don&apos;t allow the disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.

Limitation of Liability

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EXCEPT FOR ANY LIABILITY FOR PLANKY’S OR ITS AFFILIATES’ FRAUD, FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION, OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE, IN NO EVENT WILL PLANKY, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR:

(A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR

(B) ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY.

THIS WILL BE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT Planky OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

ADDITIONALLY, Planky, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES FOR MORE THAN THE GREATER OF $20 OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO Planky FOR THE PAST 12 MONTHS OF THE SERVICES IN QUESTION.

Some places don&apos;t allow the types of limitations in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.

Resolving Disputes

Let&apos;s Try To Sort Things Out First. We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Planky, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting dispute@plankyhq.com. We&apos;ll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you or Planky may bring a formal proceeding.

Judicial forum for disputes. You and Planky agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these Terms or the Services will be brought in the Maritime and Commercial High Court in Copenhagen Denmark subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below. Both you and Planky consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts.

Controlling Law

These Terms will be governed by Danish law except for its conflicts of laws principles, unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of any other jurisdiction.

Entire Agreement

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Planky with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.

Waiver, Severability &amp; Assignment

Planky&apos;s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. Planky may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.

Modifications

We may revise these Terms from time to time, and will always post the most current version on our website. If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to the email address associated with your account, posting on our blog or on this page). By continuing to use or access the Services after the revisions come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
